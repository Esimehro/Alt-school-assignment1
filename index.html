            <p>
                My name is <b>Lois Omodibo</b>, I am a student at ALT School Africa with student ID Number;
                <b>ALT/SOE/023/3219</b>. I am from Edo state Nigeria. I graduated from Delta State University, Abraka,
                where I had my first degree in Chemistry Education.
            </p>

            <p>
                I decided to join AltSchool because I'm passionate about becoming a highly skilled and innovative
                frontend developer. AltSchool's reputation for offering personalized and forward-thinking education
                aligned perfectly with my career goals. I wanted an educational experience that goes beyond traditional
                methods and focuses on practical skills, which I believe will prepare me for the ever-evolving field of
                web development.</p>

            <p>
                During my time at AltSchool, my primary goal is to gain in-depth expertise in frontend development. I
                want to master the latest technologies, frameworks, and best practices in web development. Also i want
                to leverage AltSchool's unique approach to education to become a proficient and competitive developer in
                the tech industry.

                Specifically, I aim to achieve the following at AltSchool:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I want to become a JavaScript expert, capable of building complex and interactive user interfaces
                    with ease.
                </li>

                <li>
                    I want to learn how to work effectively in a team, as collaboration is often essential in real-world
                    development projects. AltSchool's emphasis on project-based learning and teamwork will help me
                    develop these skills.
                </li>

                <li>
                    I aim to stay up-to-date with the latest trends, tools, and frameworks to remain competitive in the
                    job market since the tech industry is constantly evolving.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Build relationships with peers, mentors, and industry professionals. I believe AltSchool's
                    community-oriented approach will enable me to network with like-minded individuals and make valuable
                    connections in the tech industry.
